## Credit Card Fraud Detection

A machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.

Fraud detection is a critical task for credit card companies to ensure that customers are not charged for unauthorized purchases.

## Dataset

The dataset contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in **September 2013**.

* Total transactions: **284,807**
* Fraudulent transactions: **492**
* Class imbalance: Fraud cases represent only **0.172%** of all transactions.

This makes the dataset **highly imbalanced**, which is an important challenge when building a fraud detection model.

## Steps to Run the Project

1. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).
2. Clone or download this project repository.
3. Install the required Python packages (if not already installed).
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to train and evaluate the model.
